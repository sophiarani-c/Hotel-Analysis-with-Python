# Hotel-Analysis-with-Python
Python project on Sales Analytics for Atliq Hotels

# Problem Statement
Atliq Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, Atliq Grands is losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. They want to know insights for key questions
1. What is the occupancy percentage?
2. Which city is loosing more revenue than the other?
